TO DO:
- Collapsible top menu?
- Generate discount for each item?
- Add paginator?

TO FIX:
- Search and Category move to navbar
- Match design to screenshot (navbar)
- Move add to cart to dialog
- Shorten titles on product card

NOTES:

1. Move the search bar from Home to Header.

2. Adjust the header to take up the whole width of the window. Mobile menu remains the same.

3. Move the Add to Cart button to the Dialog window. Remove View Details button and have the product picture be clickable.

4. Shorten the titles on the product cards. Some titles are too long and interfere with the design.
